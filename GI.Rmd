# Generalized Inverses

**Definition**: A generalized inverse of the matrix

(In algebra, a system of equations (either linear or nonlinear) is
called consistent if there is at least one set of values for the
unknowns that satisfies each equation in the systemâ€”that is, when
substituted into each of the equations, they make each equation hold
true as an identity.)
